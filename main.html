<h1>Time & Space Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that efficient to execute an algorithm within a required time. </p>
<p>O(n) <b>Space Complexity</b> is a type of linear complexity that means an algorithm's space usage is directly proportional to the size of its input.</p>
